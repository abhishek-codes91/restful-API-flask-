        " 1.Restful API & Flask?\n",
        " >-A RESTful API is a way for two systems (like app and server) to talk to each other using the web.\n",
        "\n",
        " - t uses HTTP methods like:\n",
        "\n",
        "- ET → get data\n",
        "\n",
        " - OST → add data\n",
        "\n",
        " - pUT/PATCH → update data\n",
        "\n",
        " - dELETE → remove data\n",
        "\n",
        " - data is usually shared in JSON format.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Each piece of data is called a resource (like user, book, order).\n",
        "\n",
        " - REST is stateless, meaning each request works on its own (server doesn’t remember previous requests).\n",
        "\n",
        " 2.Explain the concept of API specification?\n",
        " >-API Specification (API Spec)\n",
        "\n",
        "- an API specification is like a blueprint or rulebook for how an API works.\n",
        "\n",
        "- It tells developers what the API can do, how to use it, and what to expect in return.\n",
        "\n",
        "   1.Endpoints (URLs)\n",
        "\n",
        "- Example: /users, /orders/5\n",
        "\n",
        " - Shows where to send requests.\n",
        "\n",
        "   2.Methods\n",
        "\n",
        " - Explains which HTTP methods you can use: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.\n",
        "\n",
        "   3.Parameters\n",
        "\n",
        "   - Inputs you can send with requests (like ?id=10 or { \"name\": \"John\" }).\n",
        "\n",
        "    4.Responses\n",
        "\n",
        " - What the API gives back (usually in JSON), including success and error messages.\n",
        "\n",
        "    5.Authentication Rules\n",
        "\n",
        " - How to prove who you are (like API keys, tokens, etc.).\n",
        "\n",
        " 3.What is Flask, and why is it popular for building APIs?\n",
        "\n",
        " >-Flask is a Python web framework (a set of tools) used to build web applications and APIs.\n",
        "\n",
        "- It’s called a micro-framework because it’s lightweight and doesn’t force you to use a lot of built-in features.\n",
        "\n",
        " - You just install it and quickly start making routes (endpoints) for your API.\n",
        "\n",
        " 4.What is routing in Flask?\n",
        " >-Routing in Flask means deciding which function should run when a user visits a specific URL (endpoint).\n",
        "\n",
        " - In simple words: you connect a URL to a Python function\n",
        "\n",
        " 5.How do you create a simple Flask application?\n",
        " >-Install Flask → pip install flask\n",
        "\n",
        ">-Import Flask in Python → from flask import Flask\n",
        "\n",
        ">-Create app → app = Flask(__name__)\n",
        "\n",
        ">-Define a route → @app.route(\"/\") with a function\n",
        "\n",
        ">-Run the app → app.run(debug=True)\n",
        "\n",
        " 6.What are HTTP methods used in RESTful APIs?\n",
        " >-GET → Retrieve data (read).\n",
        "\n",
        " - Example: GET /users → get all users.\n",
        "\n",
        " - POST → Create new data.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Example: POST /users → add a new user.\n",
        "\n",
        "- PUT → Update/replace existing data.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Example: PUT /users/1 → replace user with ID 1.\n",
        "\n",
        " - PATCH → Partially update existing data.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - Example: PATCH /users/1 → update only some fields of user 1.\n",
        "\n",
        " - DELETE → Remove data.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Example: DELETE /users/1 → delete user with ID 1.\n",
        "\n",
        " 7.What is the purpose of the @app.route() decorator in Flask?\n",
        " >-@app.route() in Flask is a decorator used to map a URL (route) to a function.\n",
        "\n",
        " - It tells Flask: “When someone visits this URL, run this function.”\n",
        "\n",
        " - -Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "   @app.route(\"/hello\")\n",
        "   def hello():\n",
        "    return \"Hello, World!\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        " - Visiting /hello → runs hello() function.\n",
        "\n",
        " - You can define different routes for different pages or API endpoints.\n",
        "\n",
        " - It makes routing easy and readable.\n",
        "\n",
        " 8.What is the difference between GET and POST HTTP methods?\n",
        " >-GET\n",
        "\n",
        " - Retrieve data from server\n",
        "\n",
        " - Data sent in URL (query string)\n",
        "\n",
        " - Visible in browser\n",
        "\n",
        " - Can be cached\n",
        "\n",
        "   - Idempotent (repeating doesn’t change data)\n",
        "\n",
        ">-POST\n",
        "\n",
        " - Send data to server (create/update)\n",
        "\n",
        "- Data sent in request body\n",
        "\n",
        " - Not visible in URL\n",
        "\n",
        "- Not cached\n",
        "\n",
        " - Not necessarily idempotent\n",
        "\n",
        " 9.How do you handle errors in Flask APIs?\n",
        " >-Use abort() to raise HTTP errors (e.g., abort(404)).\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Use try-except blocks to catch exceptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Create custom error handlers with @app.errorhandler().\n",
        "\n",
        " - Return JSON responses for errors.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Use proper HTTP status codes (e.g., 404, 400, 500).\n",

        " - Install Flask SQLAlchemy → pip install flask_sqlalchemy.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Import Flask and SQLAlchemy, configure database URI.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Define database models (tables) using classes.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Create the database → db.create_all().\n",
        "\n",
        " - Perform CRUD operations using db.session (add, query, update, delete).\n",
        "\n",
        " 11.What is the role of Flask-SQLAlchemy?\n",
        " >-Integrates SQLAlchemy with Flask → makes database operations easier.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Acts as an ORM (Object Relational Mapper) → lets you work with Python classes instead of raw SQL.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Simplifies CRUD operations → create, read, update, delete records using Python code.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Handles database connections automatically.\n",

        "\n",
        " 12.What are Flask blueprints, and how are they useful?\n",
        " >-Blueprints let you organize a Flask app into smaller, reusable modules.\n",
        " - They help split routes, templates, and static files for better structure.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Useful for large applications with many endpoints.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Can register the same blueprint multiple times with different URL prefixes.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Makes code maintenance easier and promotes reusability.\n",
        "\n",
        " 13.What is the purpose of Flask's request object?\n",
        " >-The request object contains all the data sent by the client to the server.\n",

        "  >-Generates URLs for routes dynamically instead of hardcoding them.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Takes the function name of a route as the first argument.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Automatically handles URL changes if route paths are updated.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Can pass parameters for dynamic routes:\n",
        "\n",
        " - url_for('user_profile', username='abhishek')\n",

        " - Facilitates documentation, testing, and collaboration between frontend and backend teams.\n",
        "\n",
        " 19.What are HTTP status codes, and why are they important in a Flask API?\n",
        " >-HTTP status codes are numeric codes sent by the server to indicate the result of a client’s request.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Common categories:\n",
        "\n",
        " - 1xx → Informational\n",
        "\n",
        " - 2xx → Success (e.g., 200 OK)\n",
        "\n",
        " - 3xx → Redirection\n",
        "\n",
        "- 4xx → Client errors (e.g., 404 Not Found)\n",
        "\n",
        " - 5xx → Server errors (e.g., 500 Internal Server Error)\n",
        "\n",
        " - They communicate the outcome of the API request to the client.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Help clients handle responses properly (e.g., retry, show error, or continue).\n",
        "\n",
        "- Essential for RESTful API standards to make APIs predictable and reliable.\n",
        "\n",
        " - In Flask, you can return status codes with responses:\n",
